## Briefs

Below is a list of brief descriptions of things that are representative of what we're involved in as a team.

1. **A system used to plan industrial production at a factory site**
An MVP is developed with a backend built in Python and uses Qt and Excel as frontend. It pulls data from a lot of different sources at the factory and does advanced calculations that control the factory site. This MVP has been built in close collaboration with workers at the factory site and it is in the process of being replaced by a production-grade setup with backend rewritten in C# and fully wrapped in a REST API. The new frontend is built as a web app using Tailwind and React. Infrastructure is containerized and deployed in Azure Cloud. The new system is well on its way (≈80% done). Current focus is to complete features to a level where the MVP can be completely retired. Immediately hereafter a handful of new features already awaits.

2. **An Open Source extension to Azure Devops**
The extension is addressing specific details in test plans and test steps in Azure Boards. One of the features in Azure DeveOps. The development takes offset in a small, existing plugin, developed single handedly by one developer. But rather than just forking the extension, we have formed an alliance with the original developer and we’re now contributing features to the extension and in the process professionalizing the plugin into a true community driven approach enhancing tests, documentation, responsiveness to feedback etc.

3. **Security scan of both code and containers**
Through a comprehensive array of various scanning tools (Snyk, CodeQL, Dependabot, Nessus and more) we’re building an ambitious declarative pipeline that can scan code base as well as live infrastructure for all possible kinds of security vulnerabilities. 

4. **Automated test of validity and truthness of AI generated replies**
An exploratory Open Source module extension to Python that can be used in traditional unit tests as a natural addition to the various assertion types in pytest. The extension explores various techniques like heuristic, GPT’s, DNN, statistics etc to assess the validity or truth of an AI generated reply relative to the given prompt.  

5. **DevX - in general**
DevX; Developer Experience. We’re building a library of tools, techniques, mastery documents, tutorials, docker images, VS Code extensions, GitHub CLI extensions, GitHub workflows and actions, git templates repos and gists, bisep declarations ...etc. that can support and optimize a DevX setup in various tool stacks. Currently we’re touching on JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Python, C#, Devcontainers, Docker, Streamlit, Testim, SQL server.

6. **From experience design to production grade continuous delivery**
We have several projects where citizen developers have built MVP’s using various levels of low-code, no-code or Python code to quickly develop and release features to production and end-users with the purpose of getting their feed-back and response. Immediately when a fit has been confirmed by end-users, we start a maturity process typically based on a combination of: Identify and componentize infrastructure elements, harden or reshape backend and wrap it in an API, Optimize data, automate verification and validation at all levels, provide access to production-like containerize environments, refactor and optimize crucial elements, engage with end users in UX and CX design activities, build  a SaaS compliant frontend in web technology.

7. **Technical Due Diligence assessment**
We’re specialized in doing formal review and assessing other people’s and team’s systems and their code bases. Clients call upon us for a number of reasons, examples could be;; A new CTO has arrived at a company and she wants to have a complete and thorough overview of the current state. It may be due to a Merger or Acquisition of two companies, It may be due to long lead times and low quality in the system, and a wish for a roadmap to follow towards a continuous delivery setup
