## Life as a consultant

Life as a consultant is somewhat different than the average full-time employment in an _ordinary_ company.

We're special. Of course every company says that, but here's a story about _how_ exactly we are actually special:

[The Tech Collective](https://www.linkedin.com/company/thetechcollective/) is a child of [Implement Consulting Group](https://www.linkedin.com/company/implement-consulting-group/), we belong together, work together. We live in the same buildings, eat the same lunch, we work the same customers; we're inseparable â€” and yet we go our own way.

Implement (IM_) â€” who powers us â€” is a management consultancy and for that reason alone The Tech Collective (.ttc) is not your average tech consultancy. We have inherited a lot of the ways of a management consultancy and that is extraordinary  in some aspects for a tech consultancy. First of all management consultancies tend to have a better grip on top management than tech consultancies and it opens up a lot of doors for us.

Also the culture in a management consultancy is somewhat different than your average tech consultancy. Not contradictory ar clashing but _different_. Perhaps there's an subtle implicit perception that .ttc exists to serve IM_. But this is something that most .ttc's would defy and mosts IM_'s would deny ðŸ¤£ 

We're equals ðŸ’ª 

.ttc is a huge success inside IM_ at there is a lot of respect around what we're doing. Building a software development team and engaging in software development is new to IM_ and and even to most of .ttc.

So even if software development as a discipline is old as Methuselah we're actually breaking new ground.

To fit as explorer or pioneer in this setup we believe you could thrive here if: 

âœ”ï¸Ž You are tool agnostic â€” like us<br/>
âœ”ï¸Ž You eat complexity for breakfast - software is your cutlery<br/>
âœ”ï¸Ž You love new technology â€“ you are incorrigibly curious<br/>
âœ”ï¸Ž You can keep focus and contribute to a distributed team<br/>
âœ”ï¸Ž You leave a clear trace of your chain of thoughts - you are predictable and readable<br/>
âœ”ï¸Ž You communicate well, in _fluid_ English â€” even in writing<br/>
âœ”ï¸Ž You love when colleagues engage in your work â€” you seek help<br/>
âœ”ï¸Ž You are funny ðŸ¤£ 

If you check âœ”ï¸Ž all of this then The Tech Collective can offer an exceptional workplace - completely integrated with Implement Consulting Group. You would experience a high degree of personal freedom, the power of decision follows the initiative. You'll be self-managed, taking responsibility for your own time, measured only by your contribution.

You would benefit from a huge network of colleagues in â€” I dare say â€“ every thinkable business and subject matter expertise. You choses your own leader once every year. We don't do individual bonuses but instead we have team bonuses. You'll get a full home workplace if you want (and if it fits; 32" curved 4K monitor er standard). Gourmet lunch every day is complementary and even dinner if you hang out that long. Your ambitious career path is individually adjusted in continious dialogue with you _Focus Contract Leader_ â€” your mentor. And your further education is streamlined in Implement University.

> - _"No, definitely not in the sense that we compete with each other; we don't!"_ 

But it is definitely a high paced and highly productive world and you would thrive if you are comfortable with seizing opportunities as they appear. Maybe even spot them yourself, rather than have them served.
